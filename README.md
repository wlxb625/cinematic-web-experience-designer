## What it solves

Most AI-generated frontends jump directly from a brief to generic components. This skill adds the missing visual-direction layer:

- Visual world and primary subject definition
- Scene-based page structure instead of component stacking
- Image, video, 3D, shader, and typography integration
- Scroll timelines with trigger, pin, scrub, progress, and scene handoff
- Separate desktop and mobile art direction
- High-, standard-, and low-performance fallbacks
- Screenshot, recording, reverse-scroll, and reduced-motion validation

## Core workflow

```text
Product diagnosis
→ Three visual directions
→ Visual-world definition
→ Scene sequencing
→ Media direction
→ Scroll and interaction timeline
→ Responsive art direction
→ Technical architecture
→ Scene-by-scene implementation
→ Visual and performance validation
```

## Scroll-linked experience requirements

A heavy-motion scene must define:

- Trigger, start, end, and scroll distance
- Pin and scrub behavior
- A normalized `0 → 1` progress timeline
- Visual state at 0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100%
- Continuity received from the previous scene and handed to the next
- Desktop, mobile, reduced-motion, and low-performance behavior
- Fast-scroll, reverse-scroll, pause-at-midpoint, and resize validation

The included React example uses GSAP ScrollTrigger and `@gsap/react` to demonstrate a pinned scroll scene without storing frame-level progress in React state.

```bash
npm install gsap @gsap/react
```

## Included concept example

The `Tongxing / 同行` example uses a **memory-growth space** as its visual world. A memory core expands into fragments and a knowledge graph, transforms into a growth timeline, and finally becomes a calm sunrise scene.

## Version

Current package: **v1.1** — scroll orchestration, media scrubbing, scene continuity, mobile fallbacks, and recording-based QA.
